## General Notes

* All Java programs use basic to intermediate-level syntax.
* GUI-based applications are developed using Java AWT.
* Each folder contains one or more `.java` files and is named according to the lab number.
* Activities are written to be beginner-friendly and are commented for clarity.

## Running the Projects

To compile and run any Java file, navigate to its folder and use:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

Replace `FileName` with the class name inside each activity folder.
