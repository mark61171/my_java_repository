## General Notes

* All Java programs use basic to intermediate-level syntax.
* GUI-based applications are developed using Java AWT.
* Each folder contains a single `.java` file and is named according to the lab number.
* Activities are coded in a way that's beginner-friendly and commented where needed.

## Running the Projects

To run any Java file:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

Replace `FileName` with the class name inside each activity folder.
